                        <p class="semi-bold">This is one of the classic titles originally know as the "Heinlein
                            Juveniles," written in the 1950 and published for the young adult market. It has since been
                            in print for 50 years in paperback, and now returns to hardcover for a new generation.
                            Travel to other planets is a reality, and with overpopulation stretching the resources of
                            Earth, the necessity to find habitable worlds is growing ever more urgent. With no time to
                            wait years for communication between slower-than-light spaceships and home, the Long Range
                            Foundation explores an unlikely solution--human telepathy.
                            Identical twins Tom and Pat are enlisted to be the human radios that will keep the ships in
                            contact with Earth. The only problem is that one of them has to stay behind, and that one
                            will grow old while the other explores the depths of space.Always a master of insight into
                            the human consequences of future technologies, this is one of Heinlein's triumphs.

                                within reach, Dan's greedy partner and even greedier fiancée steal his work and leave
                                him penniless, and trick him into taking the long sleep—suspended animation for thirty
                                years.
